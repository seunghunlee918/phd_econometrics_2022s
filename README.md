# Introduction to Econometrics 2 (Spring 2022)

This repository contains the TA notes and recitation slides I have used for the 2022 Spring semester. It includes the TeX files for the lecture notes and recitation slides used in Spring 2022 semester. Please contact me (sl4436@columbia.edu) or send a pull request if you spot any errors.

### Book (to be released soon)
This folder contains one TeX file that compiles all topics covered in Introduction to Econometrics 2 class in Columbia University. It combines the materials used in Spring 2020, and Spring 2022 semesters. 

### Lecture Notes
The following topics are covered at each recitation


|Recitation    |  Topics Covered  |
|--------------|------------------|
|Recitation 1  |  Classical linear models and IV: Sources of endogeneity and estimation  |
|Recitation 2  |  Various IV estimators and linear GMM models      |
|Recitation 3  |  Various tests in IV/GMM framework: Endogeneity tests |
|Recitation 4  |  Various tests in IV/GMM framework: Weak IV and many IV problems |
|Recitation 5  |  Clustered standard errors and Time series (stationarity and ergodicity) |
|Recitation 6  |  Time series regressions (AR, MA) and Panel regression (Pooled OLS and Random effects)  |
|Recitation 7  |  Panel regression: Fixed effects and dynamic panels  |
|Recitation 8  |  Quantile regression and Nonparametrics (kernel density estimation) |
|Recitation 9  |  Local polynomial estimation |
|Recitation 10 |  Semiparametric regression and Treatment effects under random assignment/conditional independence |
|Recitation 11  |  DiD, TWFE, LATE, and MTE  |
|Recitation 12 | Regression discontinuity and decision-tree methods in machine learning |

### Recitation Slides
I have made separate slides for each sessions. Each recitation covers roughly the same topic as in the recitation notes.   <br>
